Download [latest release](https://github.com/j000/Sharpshooter/zipball/v1.7)  \r\n2. Unpack into *mods* folder\r\n3. Bind keys in main menu\r\n4. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n### Detailed feature description:\r\n\r\nThis bot, actually the head hunting mod, will find the best head for you if your are using \"regular\" bullets. As for your shotguns with explosive ammo loaded, center of the body is the most desirable position.\r\n\r\nWhen you are trying to strike an enemy with your melee weapon and there is a possible hit, it will guide you to aim his head, too.\r\n\r\nIt does not claim to have 100% accuracy! Depending on the accuracy of your weapon. (But it can easily reach 80%+ though.)\r\n\r\nAuto-triggering is also one of the features, But for those who want to pull trigger themselves, manual-triggering is available as well.\r\n\r\nThe sector between 30 degrees to your left and 30 degrees to your right is your \"kill zone\".\r\n\r\nEffective distance is one of the features. It lets you make good use of your ammo.\r\n\r\nFor those inaccurate weapons(e.g. SMG, shotgun...) will aim \"far\" targets but not auto-shoot them EVEN IF you have auto-shoot toggle on (except for aiming snipers), because their \"effective distance\" is limited.\r\n(If you have really made up your mind to destroy the \"far\" target, you may just waste your own ammo.)\r\n\r\nSeparate experience of using GL40 (try it, you probably like it)!\r\n\r\nCounter attack feature. If an enemy attacked from right behind your back, there is almost no chance that he fires second time.\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit values inside those files to what you want!\r\n\r\nAnd other detailed details that I failed to remember...  \r\n\r\n----------\r\nOriginally created by **ws793718** on unknowncheats.me and depending on PD2Hook.yml  \r\nhttp://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/payday-2-a/133362-sharpshooters-lua-pack.html\r\n",
