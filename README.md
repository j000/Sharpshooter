<!-- Sharpshooter -->
Did you ever tire of aiming fast-moving enemy?  
Did you ever dream of becoming a legendary sniper that does not miss a single shot?  
Did you deplete your ammo in the middle of a mission *again* due to poor ammo efficiency?  
**My solution is:**

# Sharpshooter bot for *Payday 2*

### What do those scripts do:

Make your aiming job very easy - just press "B" key (first) and "Z" key (second).  
Press right mouse button, wait for it to search for the best target and pull the trigger.  
All you need to do is to watch the show!  

### Installation guide:

Edit your "PD2Hook.yml" according to the header of each file.  
Enjoy!

### Detailed feature description:

This bot, actually the head hunting mod, will find the best head for you if your are using "regular" bullets. As for your shotguns with explosive ammo loaded, center of the body is the most desirable position.

When you are trying to strike an enemy with your melee weapon and there is a possible hit, it will guide you to aim his head, too.

It does not claim to have 100% accuracy! Depending on the accuracy of your weapon. (But it can easily reach 80%+ though.)

Auto-triggering is also one of the features, But for those who want to pull trigger themselves, manual-triggering is available as well.

The sector between 30 degrees to your left and 30 degrees to your right is your "kill zone".

Effective distance is one of the features. It lets you make good use of your ammo.

For those inaccurate weapons(e.g. SMG, shotgun...) will aim "far" targets but not auto-shoot them EVEN IF you have auto-shoot toggle on (except for aiming snipers), because their "effective distance" is limited.
(If you have really made up your mind to destroy the "far" target, you may just waste your own ammo.)

~~New~~ experience of using GL40 (try it, you probably like it)!

Counter attack feature. If an enemy attacked from right behind your back, there is almost no chance that he fires second time.

Feel free to edit values inside those files to what you want!

And other detailed details that I failed to remember...
